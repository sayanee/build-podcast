##Things to learn with Oh My ZSH

####1. iTerm

- `ctrl + cmd + t` to hide and show terminal
-  **tabs**:
    -  new tab: `cmd + t`
    - toggle through tabs: `shift + cmd + [` or `shift + cmd + ]`
- **panes**:
    - new pane: `shift + opt + cmd + v` for vertical or `shift + opt + cmd + h` for horizontal pane
    - toggle through panes: `cmd + [` or `cmd + ]`
    - switch pane with mouse: Preference > Pointer > Miscellaneous Setting > Focus follows Mouse
- search with `cmd + f` and `opt + enter` to copy to clipboard
- automcomplete for commands in history with `cmd + ;`

####2. zsh

1. change to zsh in iTerm: Preference > Profiles > General > Command > choose Command > `/bin/zsh`
